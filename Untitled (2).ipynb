By mapping high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space, some details and nuances in the original data may be sacrificed. The challenge is to strike a balance between reducing dimensionality and preserving important information.\n",

    "Linear dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), assume linear relationships between variables. In real-world datasets, relationships may be non-linear, and linear techniques may not capture the full complexity of the data. Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), address this to some extent but come with their own set of challenges.\n",
    "Algorithm Sensitivity to Parameters:\n",
